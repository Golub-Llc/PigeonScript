# PigeonScript - Cooing into the Future of Programming

Welcome to PigeonScript, the revolutionary programming language designed with pigeons in mind! 

PigeonScript breaks the mold of traditional languages, offering an intuitive and avian-inspired syntax that makes coding accessible to feathered friends of all levels.

**Key Features:**

* **Coo-ious Syntax:** PigeonScript replaces dry keywords with familiar cooing sounds, making coding a natural extension of a pigeon's vocal repertoire.
* **Flock-Based Logic:** Control flow statements are inspired by flocking behavior, allowing pigeons to write elegant code that leverages their collective intelligence.
* **Crumb-Sized Data:** Data types are designed to reflect the importance of crumbs in a pigeon's life, making data management a breeze.
* **Built-in Breadcrumb Navigation:** Effortlessly navigate through code with intuitive breadcrumb trails, mimicking a pigeon's natural foraging patterns.

**Getting Started:**

PigeonScript is still under development, but here's a glimpse into what you can expect:

1. **Installation:**
     On windows install the .exe that will be added
     On Linux for debian install the .deb that will be added
     On arch search for the aur package when we make one
     On Macos run the .dmg  that will be added
3. **Your First Coo (Hello World!):**

```coode
coo.console.log-print("Hello World!")
